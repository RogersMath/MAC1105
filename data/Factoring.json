    "correct": "5x²y - 10xy² + 15x²y²",

      "(x - 2y)(x² + xy - 3y²)",

      "(x + 3y)(x² - 4xy + 2y²)"
    ],
    "correct": "(x - 2y)(x² + xy - 3y²)",
    "explanation": "This expression can be factored by grouping. Group the first two and last two terms, factor out common factors, then factor out the common binomial: (x²(x - y) - 6y²(x - y)) = (x - y)(x² + 6y). The second factor can be further factored as (x + 2y)(x - 3y), giving the final result (x - 2y)(x² + xy - 3y²).",

    "correct": "(3x - 2)(x - 4)",
    "explanation": "For this trinomial with a leading coefficient of 3, we need two numbers that multiply to give 3 * 8 = 24 and add to give -14. These numbers are -2 and -12, so the factored form is (3x - 2)(x - 4).",
